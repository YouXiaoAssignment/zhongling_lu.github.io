Hi, this is Zhongling Lu's personal website! I am an undergraduate student majoring physics at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. I am interested in quantum chaos, quantum information and theoretical condensed matter physics.

I am currently visiting Professor Eric Heller's group at Harvard University, where I am working on exotic quantum ergodicity phenomena called antiscarring. Collaborator: Dr. Ceren Dag.

From Apr. 2024 till present, I'm working on Keldysh scars in dissipative quantum many-body (chaotic) systems. Advisor: Prof.Antonio Garcia-Garcia, collaborator: Prof. Jacobus Verbaarschot, Dr. Lucas Sa.

From Jul. 2023 to Jun. 2024, I worked on a project of exotic dynamical properties of emergent monopole excitations in pressured induced classical spin ice systems, which are found to be dynamcally localized but deconfined. (Soon to appear on PRB). Advisor: Prof. Chris Laumann, co-author: Dr. Jonathan Hallen, Dr. Robin Schaefter. (https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18649)

From Sep.2022 to Dec.2022, I was a visiting special undergraduate at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Course attended: 8.231 Theory of quantum solid, Prof. Xiao-gang Wen. 
8.333(G) Statistical mechanics I, Prof. Senthil Todadri.
